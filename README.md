## Features

### 🎵 Audio Sources

- **Local Files** — Drag and drop or browse to load MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, and other common formats. Full waveform display with seek and loop handles.
- **YouTube** — Paste any YouTube URL to stream the audio directly inside the editor. Includes a visual playback progress indicator with A-B loop support.
- **Spotify** — Connect your Spotify Premium account via OAuth to load and play tracks from Spotify's catalog directly in the editor.

### Editor Modes

- **LRC Mode** — Line-by-line synchronization with millisecond-accurate timestamps. Hit a configurable key (default: `Space`) to stamp the current playback position onto the active line.
- **SRT Mode** — Subtitle format with start and end times per line. Each line gets both an in and out timestamp for precise subtitle placement.
- **Words Mode** — Per-word karaoke synchronization. Each word in a line gets its own independent timestamp, enabling animated karaoke-fill playback in the preview.

### Timing & Synchronization

- **Keyboard-driven stamping** — Fully configurable shortcut keys for marking, nudging, and navigating lines during sync sessions.
- **Fine nudging** — Shift timestamps forward or backward by configurable increments (default: 0.1s / 0.01s fine).
- **Bulk shift** — Select multiple lines and shift their timestamps simultaneously.
- **Global offset** — Shift all timestamps at once.
- **A-B loop** — Set loop start and end points on the waveform or progress bar to practice a section repeatedly.
- **Auto-pause on mark** — Optionally pause playback automatically after stamping a line.
- **Overlapping timestamp detection** — Visual badge warns when two lines share the same timestamp.

### Lyric Content

- **Secondary lyrics** — Add a secondary text track per line (e.g., romaji, alternate language pronunciation).
- **Translation layer** — A separate per-line translation field (e.g., an English translation alongside the main lyrics).
- **Furigana / Ruby markup** — Annotate CJK characters with readings using `{字|じ}` syntax. The editor renders ruby markup above the character inline.
- **CJK-aware tokenization** — Japanese, Chinese, and Korean text is automatically split character-by-character for per-character timing; Latin runs are kept as whole-word tokens.
- **Reading format** — Toggle between Hiragana and Katakana for phonetic reading display.
- **Dual-line display** — Optionally show the next line below the active line during sync for better readability.

### Import

- **Paste / Type** — Enter lyrics directly in the editor's text input.
- **File import** — Load existing `.lrc`, `.srt`, or `.txt` files. Word-level LRC (Enhanced LRC) is also supported and preserves per-word timestamps.
- **URL import** — Import lyrics from a remote URL via the import panel.
- **Paste detection** — Pasting an LRC or SRT block into the editor is automatically detected and parsed.
- **Genius Search & Extraction** — Search for songs on Genius.com directly from the setup wizard or the editor toolbar, preview the lyrics, and import them instantly as unsynced lines.

### Export

- **LRC download** — Standard `[MM:SS.xx]` format with optional word timestamps (`<MM:SS.xx>`).
- **SRT download** — `HH:MM:SS,ms --> HH:MM:SS,ms` format with optional second-line secondary content.
- **Copy to clipboard** — Instantly copy the compiled LRC or SRT output.
- **LRC metadata tags** — Optionally include `[ti:]`, `[ar:]`, `[al:]`, `[lg:]` header tags.
- **Configurable precision** — Choose hundredths (`[01:23.45]`) or thousandths (`[01:23.456]`) precision for both line and word timestamps.
- **Line endings** — Select LF or CRLF for compatibility with different media players.
- **Strip empty lines** — Automatically omit unsynced or blank lines from the output.
- **Normalize timestamps** — Sort and deduplicate timestamps on export.
- **Filename pattern** — Export file named `lyrics.lrc` (fixed) or derived from the project title (media-based).
- **Translation & secondary toggles** — Choose whether to include the secondary track and/or translations in the exported file.
- **Server compilation with local fallback** — Export compiles on the server for advanced formatting; automatically falls back to the local compiler if the server is unavailable.

### Live Preview

- **Real-time karaoke preview** — The preview panel highlights the currently playing line and fills words character-by-character as they play (in Words mode).
- **Karaoke fill easing** — Choose between linear (accurate) and ease-in/out (smooth) word fill animation.
- **Fill track selection** — Apply the animated fill to the main text, secondary text, or both.
- **Translation display** — Optionally show the translation layer below each lyric line in the preview.
- **Furigana display** — Toggle ruby text annotations visible in the preview.
- **Font size** — Four size presets: Small, Normal, Large, X-Large.
- **Line spacing** — Compact, Normal, or Relaxed spacing between lines.
- **Preview alignment** — Left, center, or right alignment.
- **Auto-scroll** — Automatically scrolls the active line into view; configurable alignment (center, top, nearest, off) and scroll behavior (smooth / instant).

### Project Management

- **Project library** — Browse, search, and manage all your projects. Each project stores lyrics, timestamps, media references, and editor state.
- **Cloud sync** — Authenticated users have projects saved to the server automatically. Projects are created on first save and patched incrementally for efficiency.
- **Guest Mode & Project Claiming** — Edit and work on projects without creating an account. When ready to save, pre-create the project and securely migrate it to your account seamlessly upon signing in via a one-time secure claim token.
- **Autosave** — Dual-condition autosave fires after a configurable time interval or after 5 line edits, whichever comes first.
- **Manual save** — Save button with autosave status indicator (spinner → checkmark).
- **Local storage fallback** — All project data is also mirrored to `localStorage` so work is never lost offline.
- **Uploads library** — View all audio files and YouTube/Spotify tracks previously associated with projects.
- **Shared project viewer** — Open a read-only view of a shared project with its embedded media and synced lyrics.
- **Project metadata** — Store a project name, description, and tags.

### Sharing

- **Public/private sharing** — Generate a shareable URL for any project. Toggle between public (anyone with link) and private (owner only) visibility.
- **Deep link with timestamp** — Include a `?s=N` query param in the share URL to start playback at a specific second.
- **Current position shortcut** — One-click sync of the share timestamp to the current playback position.

## Docker Deployment Considerations

### With Docker Compose (Default Values)

When you run `docker-compose up` without providing custom environment variables, the following features are **immediately available**:

✅ **Working with defaults:**

- User authentication (register, login, logout)
- Profile management
- Project CRUD operations
- Lyrics editing and management
- Audio uploads (local files, drag-and-drop)
- Core editor features (LRC/SRT/Words modes)
- All keyboard shortcuts and settings
- All UI themes and customization options

⚠️ **Limited with defaults (dummy API keys):**

- **Password reset emails** — The flow works, but emails won't send (uses dummy SMTP credentials)
- **Cloudinary uploads** — Uses demo account with storage/bandwidth limitations
- **Spotify integration** — Won't connect without real credentials
- **YouTube integration** — Won't fetch video metadata with dummy API key
- **Genius lyrics** — Search and one-click import won't work (requires a Genius Client Access Token)
- **reCAPTCHA** — Uses Google's public test key (always passes validation)

### Enabling Full Features

To use all features including email, file uploads, and third-party integrations, you'll need to provide real API credentials:

1. **Create a `.env.local` file** based on `.env.docker`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.docker .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your real credentials:**

   ```bash
   # Email (for password reset)
   EMAIL_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
   EMAIL_SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

   # Cloudinary (for file uploads)
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

   # Spotify (for music streaming)
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret

    # YouTube (for video metadata)
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your-youtube-api-key

    # Genius API (for lyrics search)
    GENIUS_CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-genius-client-access-token

    # reCAPTCHA (for bot protection)
    RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
    VITE_RECAPTCHA_KEY=your-public-key
   ```

3. **Run with your configuration:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --env-file .env.local up -d --build
   ```

For complete Docker configuration instructions, see the [Docker Containerization Guide](../../DOCKER.md).

```

### Enhanced LRC (Word-level)

```lrc
[00:10.50]<00:10.50>Hold <00:11.00>me <00:11.40>close
[00:15.20]<00:15.20>Don't <00:15.80>let <00:16.10>go
```

### With Secondary / Furigana

Multiple lines sharing a timestamp stack vertically in compatible players:

```lrc
[00:10.50]持ち上げて
[00:10.50]mochiagete
[00:10.50]Lift me up
```
